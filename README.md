Raw data used in the manuscript
The folder "energy_vs_twist" contains data in 2-column format, i.e. twist angle (degree) and total energy (eV) calculated by LAMMPS using method described in the manuscript. The size of hexagonal hBN flake is from 20 to 1000 times lattice constant (2.505 Angstrom). All flakes have armchair edges.
